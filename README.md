Industries in the Miscellaneous Manufacturing subsector make a wide range of products that cannot readily be classified in specific NAICS subsectors in manufacturing.

Main stakeholders: Customers and local communities. 


# TASK 2 

CR4=4,76+3,46+3.26+2,67=14,15% 
Due to the results, we can conclude that the miscellaneous manufacturing industry (NAICS 3399) is a very competitive industry (CR4<40%).

# TASK 3 

Most of the companies of our sector are public limited companies. 
Our company is going to be a private limited company.  The reasons why we have chosen this type of company are: 
- Corporate businesses have the most sales 
- We can have limited liability, it is an  advantage because in case we cannot pay the debt our personal assets are not at risk. 
- Because we are a small company, we cannot afford to set up a public limited company  

# TASK 4

### SWOT Analysis 

### OPPORTUNITIES:  
- Our business would make products with biodegradable materials so it is an advantage because people nowadays are more interested in this type of products because of climate change. 
- Low concentration ratio in our industry. 

### THREATS:  
- The COVID-19 crisis, the bigger business which make the same as our business but with non-biodegradable products so the price is lower. 

### STRENGTHS:  
- The materials that we are going to use for the 3D printer is cheap so the costs of the products would be cheaper and that could be an advantage. 

### WEAKNESSES:  
- In our business we make different types of products so we will need more different molds so we would need to spend more money. We are a small business so we do not have so much money. 

### Business strategy 

We are going to mix both business strategies. We will try to reduce costs by using the cheaper materials so that way the products would  also be cheaper. On the other hand, we will also focus on delivering outstanding products with additional characteristics. So our products will be different because they are made with biodegradable materials and you can customize the product.

# Task 6 

### Playmobil iberica SAU 
Current ratio= current assets/current liabilities: 34,480,297/19,736,443=1.75 
This means that for every 1euro for current liabilities, the business has 1.75euros of current assets. This is a promising number. 

Acid test ratio = (current assets-stock)/current liabilities: (34,480,297-14,313,717)/ 19,736,443=1.02 
This means that for every euro in current liabilities, 1.02€ are held in liquid assets. That is good, because it means that the company will be able to pay its debts. 

Receivables turnover:  Operating revenue/accounts receivable: 72,839,665/15,866,593=4.59 
This means that, on average, the company collects its receivables 4.59 times in one year. 

Total debt: current liabilities +non-current liabilities=19,736,443+34,768=19,771,211 

Debt to total assets ratio=total debt/total assets=19,771,221/35,267,719=0.56 
This means that in 2019 the company had 0.56€ of debt for every euro of assets. In other words, the company financed each euro of assets with 0.56€ of debt. This is good because it means that the company has more assets than liabilities. 

Times interest earned= (Operating P/L)/ financial expenses=4,129,121/29,176=141.52 
This means that the company's interest expense is very well covered at 141.52 times. 

ROA :Profits for the period/total assets=3,801,650/35,267,719=0.10 
This means that the company earned 0.10€ on every euro of total assets. 

ROE: Profits for the period/shareholder's funds=3,801,650/15,496,508=0.24 
This means that the company earned 0.24€ on every euro invested by its owners. 

As a conclusion, we could say that this company's financial health is really good. 

# TASK 7

Multifactor productivity has no clear tendency in this industry, as the graph is very irregular. The decrease in 2009 is probably because of the recession, and the peak was in 2011.
